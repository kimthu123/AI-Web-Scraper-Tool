    "summary": "Climate science is the multidisciplinary field that studies the Earth's\nclimate and its evolution. At the very core of climate science are\nindispensable climate models that predict future climate scenarios, inform\npolicy decisions, and dictate how a country's economy should change in light of\nthe changing climate. Climate models capture a wide range of interacting\ndynamic processes via extremely complex ordinary and partial differential\nequations. To model these large-scale complex processes, climate science\nleverages supercomputers, advanced simulations, and statistical methods to\npredict future climate. An area of engineering that is rarely studied in\nclimate science is control engineering. Given that climate systems are\ninherently dynamic, it is intuitive to analyze them within the framework of\ndynamic system science. This perspective has been underexplored in the\nliterature. In this manuscript, we provide a tutorial that: (i) introduces the\ncontrol engineering community to climate dynamics and modeling, including\nspatiotemporal scales and challenges in climate modeling; (ii) offers a fresh\nperspective on climate models from a control systems viewpoint; and (iii)\nexplores the relevance and applicability of various advanced graph and network\ncontrol-based approaches in building a physics-informed framework for learning,\ncontrol and estimation in climate systems. We also present simple and then more\ncomplex climate models, depicting fundamental ideas and processes that are\ninstrumental in building climate change projections. This tutorial also builds\nparallels and observes connections between various contemporary problems at the\nforefront of climate science and their control theoretic counterparts. We\nspecifically observe that an abundance of climate science problems can be\nlinguistically reworded and mathematically framed as control theoretic ones.",
