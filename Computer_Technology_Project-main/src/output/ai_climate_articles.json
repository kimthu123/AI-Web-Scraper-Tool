Despite this success, these models face a key challenge:\npredicting future climates while being trained only with historical data. In\nthis study, we investigate this issue by analyzing boreal winter land\ntemperature biases in AI weather and climate models. We examine two weather\nmodels, FourCastNet V2 Small (FourCastNet) and Pangu Weather (Pangu),\nevaluating their predictions for 2020-2025 and Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2\n(ACE2) for 1996-2010. These time periods lie outside of the respective models'\ntraining sets and are significantly more recent than the bulk of their training\ndata, allowing us to assess how well the models generalize to new, i.e. more\nmodern, conditions. We find that all three models produce cold-biased mean\ntemperatures, resembling climates from 15-20 years earlier than the period they\nare predicting. In some regions, like the Eastern U.S., the predictions\nresemble climates from as much as 20-30 years earlier. Further analysis shows\nthat FourCastNet's and Pangu's cold bias is strongest in the hottest predicted\ntemperatures, indicating limited training exposure to modern extreme heat\nevents. In contrast, ACE2's bias is more evenly distributed but largest in\nregions, seasons, and parts of the temperature distribution where climate\nchange has been most pronounced.
